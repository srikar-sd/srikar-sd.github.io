<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>About Me</strong></p>
 
<p style="text-align: center;">I am a freshman in the Red McCombs School of Business with a currently unspecified major. I plan on majoring in marketing and combining it with my passion for music to work as an A&R rep in the music industry. My greatest passion is music and I listen to a wide variety of artists including Dua Lipa, Kendrick Lamar, Guns n' Roses, Led Zeppelin, Bruno Mars, The Rolling Stones, and many more. Outside of music, I like hanging out with friends and family in small circles and watching football (I'm a huge Broncos fan!). <br /><br /></p>
